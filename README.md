# simple-vanilla-todo

Simple, dependency-free to‑do starter built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This repository contains a small, beginner-friendly to‑do application you can use as a learning project or starter template. It uses no frameworks or build tools — just static HTML, CSS and JavaScript — and includes the following features:

- Add, complete, and remove tasks
- Duplicate detection (case-insensitive) with a toast alert
- "Execute" tasks: mark a task as executed and record the timestamp
- Persistent state using localStorage (tasks, completed & executed state are saved)
- Small, responsive layout and clean code comments so it's easy to extend
- Ready to deploy to GitHub Pages (optional workflow available)

Getting started
1. Clone the repository:
   - git clone git@github.com:<Farhanb1>/simple-vanilla-todo.git
2. Open index.html in your browser to run locally.
3. Edit files and refresh to see changes.

Files included
- index.html — markup and basic structure
- styles.css — styling and responsive layout
- script.js — application logic (add/remove/execute/duplicate checks + persistence)
- README.md — this file

Suggested next steps / ideas
- Add inline edit for tasks
- Add filtering (All / Active / Completed / Executed)
- Add drag-to-reorder using HTML5 drag/drop or a small library
- Connect to a backend (Firebase/Netlify Functions) for cross-device sync
- Add unit tests for the JS logic

Deploying to GitHub Pages (quick option)
- Option A (recommended for automated deploy): Add the included GitHub Actions workflow to .github/workflows/deploy.yml and push to main; it will publish to the gh-pages branch.
- Option B (simple): Put the site files into a docs/ folder on the main branch and set GitHub Pages source to main / docs.
